Bismillah hirrahmanur raheem

A teacher asked one student in a class in regards to the memorisation of the holy Quraan
Do you remember where the ayah "aflam yaseeru feel ardh" comes
He rememberd on some, and hesitated on the others

The teacher said say:
"Ghafaral Allah lil Hajji Muhammad Yusuf "
The he said :
Ghafarallah - in Surah Ghafir
For Hajj - in Surah Hajj
For Mohammed- in Surah Mohammed
For yusuf- in Surah Yusuf
These 4 Surah have "afalam yaseeru....." in them
(Way to learn it) 

A benifit of memorisation of holy Quraan :
Majority of what memorisers see and witness is of two types of recitation:
Like mentioned in this example:
Wa fakiha.. 
Wa fawakiha...

Similarly many similarities are mentioned like this in this way, of this type in the full Quraan and it is preferable that we apply a rule to uplift this difficulty

RULE
1)When the (surah name) is singular
Example: Surah Yaseen, Saad, Zukhruf, Toor, Rahman, Waqiah
Mentions fakiha (Singular word) 

2)when the name of surah is plural
Example :Surah Moominoon, Safaat, Mursalat
Mentions fawakiha (Plural word) 

Information of Quraan:
How do we differentiate between. "yosabbihu" and "sabbaha" at the beginning of suraahs and how do we know which one to start with?

When the first letter of the Surah name has a dot on it - will be "yusabbihu"

When first letter of surah name doesn't have a dot on it will be "sabbaha"

Example:Surah Hadeed starts with Haa and letter Haa has no dots in it, so surah will begin with "sabbaha"

Surah Taghabun starts with Taa and it has a dot in it so it will be "yusabbihu"

May Allah grant me and you the ability of memorising the holy Quraan and its recital and May peace and salutations be sent on Mohammad (S. A. W) and his family and all companions. AMEEN 💐

💐Benifit others with this 💐
May Allah reward the writer and spreader and reader and receiver for any benifit gained
And Allah forgive his/her parents and our parents and your children and the whole Muslim umaah alive or dead.
Hopefully you will spread this for full benifit and give you full reward.


Again Arabic language and English language can never be compared, just closely related translation
Allah forgive for any shortcomings
